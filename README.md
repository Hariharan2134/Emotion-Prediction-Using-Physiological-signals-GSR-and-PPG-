# Emotion-Prediction-Using-Physiological-signals-GSR-and-PPG-
# üß† Emotion Prediction from PPG and GSR Signals

This project focuses on predicting **valence**, **arousal**, and classifying **emotions** using physiological signals ‚Äî **PPG (BVP)** and **GSR**. This work was completed as part of an internship project at **NIT Trichy**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Predict continuous **valence** and **arousal** values.
- Classify data into one of six emotions:  
  `Happy`, `Excitement`, `Neutral`, `Fear`, `Sad`, `Anger`
- Implement multiple modeling approaches:
  - Machine Learning: `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`
  - Deep Learning: `CNN + BiLSTM`

üìä Sample Output
Random Forest Valence Accuracy: 93.13%

Random Forest Arousal Accuracy: 49.69%

CNN-BiLSTM MSE Loss: ~0.0065

Emotion predictions are printed based on PPG, GSR, and model outputs.

üß≠ Emotion Mapping Logic
Emotion is predicted using thresholds on predicted valence, arousal, PPG, and GSR:

Emotion	Conditions (Simplified)
Happy	High valence, high arousal, high PPG + GSR
Excitement	High valence, low arousal, high PPG
Neutral	Mid valence & arousal, normal PPG/GSR
Fear	Low valence, low arousal, low PPG + GSR
Sad	Low valence, high arousal, low PPG, high GSR
Anger	Catch-all for other intense combinations

üìå Notes
All models were trained on merged physiological and annotation data.

SMOTE is applied to handle data imbalance.

CNN-BiLSTM requires windowed input (default: 10 time steps).
